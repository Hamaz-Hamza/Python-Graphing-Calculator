# Python-Graphing-Calculator

A basic python app made using the turtle library. Can graph most functions which do not have a vertical asymptote.

How is this done?
The user's input is evaluated using the eval funtion for each x value in the horizontal range.
The corresponding y value is used to draw a discrete point on the screen at the correct location. 
Due to the large amount of x values the resulting graph looks mostly continous.
